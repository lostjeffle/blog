## NVMe - Zoned Namespace


### Concept

#### namespace

> A namespace is a collection of logical block addresses (LBA) accessible to host software. A namespace ID (NSID) is an identifier used by a controller to provide access to a namespace. A namespace is not the physical isolation of blocks, rather the isolation of logical blocks addressable by the host software.
> There are many reasons why host software would want to break up an NVMe SSD into multiple namespaces: for logical isolation, multi-tenancy, security isolation (encryption per namespace), write protecting a namespace for recovery purposes, overprovisioning to improve write performance and endurance and so on.
